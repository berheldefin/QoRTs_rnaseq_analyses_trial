NOTE: maximum allocation memory = 1.073741824 gigabytes.
    This might be ok, or might cause OutOfMemoryExceptions later.
    For most large datasets/genomes at least 4 gb is recommended.
    (Actual required memory may be less than this.)
    To increase the memory maximum, include the parameter -Xmx
    in between the java command and the -jar parameter.
    For example: to increase the memory maximum to 4 gigabytes:
        java -Xmx4G -jar /path/to/jar/QoRTs.jar QC ...

QoRTs is Running in any-sorted mode.
Chromosome size file added. Adding target wiggle plot generation.
No parameter --genomeFA found.
NOTE: Function "overlapMatch" requires function "mismatchEngine". Adding "mismatchEngine" to the active function list...
